This repository contains notebooks to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript *Oceanic fingerprints of continental and glacial terrestrial runoff in Inuit Nunangat, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago* by B. Rogalla, S. E. Allen, M. Colombo., P. G. Myers, K. J. Orians (2022). It is divided into:

* **forcing** - Notebooks that are used to create the forcing files of the Mn model (other forcing files found at https://github.com/brogalla/Mn-sea-ice-paper).
* **paper materials** - Notebooks that are used to create the figures in the paper. File naming conventions; if the Jupyter Notebook starts with:
  - "S" --> supplementary materials
  - "M" --> methods
  - "R" --> results
  - "D" --> discussion
  
The following number(s) corresponds to the paper element number. Background maps are loaded as pickles to speed up the plotting. These pickles are created in the notebook "map-pickles.ipynb".
